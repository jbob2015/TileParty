## Tile Party

Tile Party is a project I developed over Summer 2017 in efforts to learn all aspects of game development. I used OpenGL to learn basic rendering concepts, and built my own game engine from scratch. The game is a board game, with minigames, and has online multiplayer. I finished 2 minigames, with my main focus being on the framework to add content in the future. I worked directly with an artist, and we managed to have a working demo build done in 3 months of work. I plan on coming back to this project in the future, because it is very easy to add minigames and new content using the code I have already written.
