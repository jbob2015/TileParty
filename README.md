## Tile Party

Tile Party is a project I developed over Summer 2017 in efforts to learn all aspects of game development. I used OpenGL to learn basic rendering concepts, and built my own game engine from scratch. The game is a board game, with minigames, and has online multiplayer. I finished 2 minigames, with my main focus being on the framework to add content in the future. I worked directly with an artist, and we managed to have a working demo done in 3 months of work. I plan on coming back to this project in the future, because it is very easy to add minigames and new content using the code I have already written.

I found many useful resources during along the way, and will list some here:

[The Cherno Project](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject "The Cherno Project") - Invaluable resource when it came to game development. I learned about serialization and basic networking from him, can't say enough.

[Gaffer On Games](https://gafferongames.com/ "Gaffer On Games") - Tons of good stuff here. I mainly used the articles on consistent physics across computers, but he has a lot of quality content on his site.

[OpenGL Red Book](http://www.opengl-redbook.com/ "OpenGL Red Book") - Wish I could have used this more. It has everything you could ever need on OpenGL, and then some. I will use it in the future, because my rendering process is deprecated, and though I don't have issues, I would like to be using modern OpenGL for optimization purposes.
